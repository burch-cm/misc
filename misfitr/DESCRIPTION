Description: This is just a repo for junk R code that I write while binge-watching 
    random streaming shows. It's mainly for goofing off or testing an idea. 
    Useful concepts and code are often used in production projects, and useless code is accumulated for posterity, 
    makign this repo a quasi - Island of Misfit Code.
